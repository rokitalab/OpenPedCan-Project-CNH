# Methylation calls for molecular subtyping

**Module authors:** Jo Lynne Rokita

## Overview

This module builds one resolved methylation call per biospecimen, which molecular subtyping modules consume instead of each re-implementing score thresholds and classifier-version aliasing.

## Workflow

`01-build-methylation-calls.R` combines:

- DKFZ v12.8 / NIH v3.1 calls from `input/bti_methylation_classifications.tsv`
- DKFZ v12 / NIH v2 calls from `data/histologies-base.tsv`

Each call is mapped to a single row of `input/mnp_v12.5_v12.8_NIHv2_v3.1_annotation_with_OPC_subtypes.xlsx` through normalized keys (case and `_` vs. space), so classifier-version renames (e.g., DKFZ `ANTCON` to `GTAKA`) resolve without hand-maintained aliases.

### Confidence rule

A call is high confidence if the DKFZ subclass score is >= 0.8, or the NIH superfamily and class scores are both >= 0.9. This is the same rule used in `molecular-subtyping-Rare-CNS`. Precedence among passing calls is DKFZ v12.8, NIH v3.1, DKFZ v12, NIH v2; only calls that resolve to a crosswalk row can set the subtype.

### Subtype additions

`input/opc_subtype_additions.tsv` names subtypes for classes whose crosswalk `OPC_molecular_subtype` was blank (choroid plexus, nerve sheath, germ cell, pineal, sellar, and other rare classes). It is keyed on the NIH v2 abbreviation, never overwrites an existing crosswalk value, and carries a rationale and the genetic lesion expected for each class (`expected_lesion`, used later to confirm methylation calls).

### Control classes

Control tissues and the inflammatory microenvironment class (`INFLAM_ENV`) indicate low tumor purity and are never subtyped. The crosswalk marks these with `Control` in `OPC_molecular_subtype`, which is distinct from a blank cell (a class not yet assigned a subtype). Any NIH control code (`CONTR_*`, `CTRL_*`, `NORM_*`) is also treated as a control. These biospecimens get `methyl_control = TRUE` and no `OPC_molecular_subtype`, so they can be flagged downstream without being given a tumor subtype.

### Outputs

- `results/methylation_calls.tsv` - one row per methylation biospecimen: `methyl_confidence`, `methyl_source`, `methyl_class`, `methyl_score`, `OPC_molecular_subtype`, `rare`, family fields, `methyl_control`, `methyl_conflict` (another high-confidence call from a different version resolves to a different class), and `unmapped_high_conf_call`
- `results/methylation_crosswalk_gaps.tsv` - high-confidence classes that are not in the crosswalk, or whose crosswalk row has no `OPC_molecular_subtype`, with biospecimen counts; this is the list of subtypes still needing a rule
